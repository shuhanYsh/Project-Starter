# Calories Calculator


## Shuhan Yang

A *bulleted* list:
- Calculate basic daily calories consumption base on personal information.
- Add intake calories to total daily calories when eating food.
- Subtract consumed calories to total daily calories when doing exercies.


This project is a calories calculator which can calculate daily calories the person intake and consume. This project is 
use for someone who want to lose weight or add on weight and help them control their daily calories. The idea of doing 
this project comes from myself. I am on diet and doing exercise everyday. I have to calculate my daily calories by hand.
If I have a calories calculator, it will be more convenience for me. Hopefully the calories calculator can help more 
people like me!
